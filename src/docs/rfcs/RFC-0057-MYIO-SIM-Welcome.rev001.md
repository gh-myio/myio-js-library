Awesome direction—this is already very close. Here’s a tight review with fixes and concrete upgrades.

What’s strong (keep)

Clear scope for a Last Value widget with hero, user session, and shopping shortcuts, all brand-driven via Customer SERVER_SCOPE.

Explicit navigation behaviors for CTA, cards, and logout.

Attribute-first design (logo, palette, cards, primary state, showUserMenu) with MYIO defaults.

Detailed HTML/CSS and controller sections with palette application and logo fallback.

Security notes + audit trail and success metrics already defined.

Fixes you should make now

Timeline math
You call it “3 weeks (21 business days)” but your phase table adds up to 16 days (5+5+6). Either change the headline to 16 business days or expand tasks to fill 21.

Settings schema gaps
Add text overrides so partners can localize without touching code:

"home.hero.title": { "type":"string", "default":"Bem-vindo ao MYIO Platform" },
"home.hero.description": { "type":"string", "default":"Gestão inteligente de energia, água e recursos para shoppings centers" },
"home.actions.primaryLabel": { "type":"string", "default":"ACESSAR DASHBOARD" }


(Place these alongside the existing palette/cards schema.)

Per-card action flexibility
Today a card only supports dashboardId. Add optional state and openInNewTab:

"home.cards[].state": { "type":"string", "description":"Dashboard state to navigate to" },
"home.cards[].openInNewTab": { "type":"boolean", "default": false }


This future-proofs mixed navigation without a breaking change.

Robust Customer lookup
The customerId derivation via configuredDatasources[0] can be missing on some Home setups. Add a fallback:

Try ctx.stateController.dashboardCtx.currentCustomerId (when available).

If still missing, render with defaults and log a single warning (you already warn/log; just broaden the source).

Accessibility / keyboard
Your CSS/HTML is good, but add:

tabindex="0" on .shopping-card and key handler for Enter/Space to trigger navigation.

aria-label on CTA and cards (use title/subtitle strings).
This helps hit your ≥90 a11y target.

Palette validation & safe CSS
You note injection controls conceptually; enforce it in code:

Validate hex/rgba via regex before applying to style.setProperty.
(You already call out validation; implement the guard where applyPalette runs.)

User menu source of truth
RFC says “reuse MENU logic”; the attached controller pulls from ctx.currentUser—good. Add a tiny guard for empty names (you started doing this) and ensure logout falls back to token clear + redirect (you have it—finish the snippet).

Performance polish

Lazy-load background images on cards (IntersectionObserver), since cards can overflow horizontally. Your CSS and structure support this; it’ll help hit <500ms painted content on slower machines.

Nice-to-haves (won’t block)

Add a small “Brand Preview” dev helper: a hidden query param (?brandPreview=customerId) to fetch a different Customer’s palette—useful for QA.

Optional home.brand.backgroundUrl to override the hero background image you bundle in CSS.

Test plan tweaks (fast wins)

Add unit tests for applyPalette() (assert computed styles) and renderUserMenu() (hidden vs visible) to complement your renderShortcuts cases.

Add an integration test for no customer / missing token paths to ensure graceful defaults.

Content alignment check (RFC vs. UI)

The hero/title/desc/CTA in the template match the “home” copy; adding the three text attributes above will let partners swap for English/Spanish without forking.

Cards row + hover/scroll behavior already spec’d nicely.

Verdict

Ship it—with the timeline fix and the schema/robustness changes above. The attached RFC already contains the right building blocks (files, attributes, behaviors) and aligns with your goal of keeping the existing HTML widget while introducing a partner-ready LV widget.
