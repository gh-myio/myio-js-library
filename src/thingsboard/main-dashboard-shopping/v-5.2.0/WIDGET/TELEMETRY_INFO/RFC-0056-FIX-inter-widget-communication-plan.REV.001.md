Your plan is excellent: it‚Äôs structured like a full RFC (objectives ‚Üí architecture ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí validation ‚Üí risks), and it clearly maps each change to the relevant widget. Here‚Äôs a concise review with improvement notes:

üëç Strengths

Architecture clarity

The diagram showing MAIN_VIEW ‚Üí TELEMETRY ‚Üí TELEMETRY_INFO communication is precise and matches the ThingsBoard runtime behavior.

Using CustomEvent on window is the correct abstraction ‚Äî simple, cross-widget safe, and TB-compatible.

Implementation detail

Code samples for emitLojasTotal() and emitAreaComumBreakdown() are production-ready.

Receiver logic (RECEIVED_DATA, canRecalculate, recalculateWithReceivedData) is well isolated.

Cleanup on onDestroy is correctly included to avoid memory leaks.

Validation & Testing

Example test scenarios (Entrada 1000 kWh ‚Üí Total = 1000 kWh) are concrete.

The validation tolerance and logs are appropriate for QA.

Risk awareness

You identified timing and order-of-load issues correctly and suggested fallback events and caching ‚Äî very good.

‚öôÔ∏è Recommended Refinements
Area	Suggestion	Rationale
Event Names	Use a shared prefix, e.g. myio:telemetry:update with detail.type = 'lojas_total' or 'areacomum_breakdown'.	Simplifies listener cleanup (single add/remove) and helps trace events in the console.
Period Matching	Before accepting an event, verify periodKey exactly matches current filter.	Prevents cross-period mix-ups when user switches filters rapidly.
Debounce	Add a 300‚Äì500 ms debounce on recalculateWithReceivedData().	Reduces redundant recalculations when both events arrive close together.
Fallback Mechanism	Implement a myio:telemetry:request-refresh broadcast from TELEMETRY_INFO after 3 s if canRecalculate() is false.	Guarantees recovery when one widget fails to emit.
Unit Labeling	Normalize all units to MWh (round 2 decimals) inside emit* before dispatch.	Ensures consistent numeric domain across widgets.
Error Visibility	If Entrada < (sum consumers), display small ‚ö†Ô∏è marker in UI (not just console).	Helps field debugging without developer console.
Performance	Cache last totals in sessionStorage keyed by domain+periodKey.	Allows fast restore after dashboard reload without waiting events.
